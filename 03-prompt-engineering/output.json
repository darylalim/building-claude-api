These neurobiological findings have prompted psychologists to develop trauma-informed therapeutic interventions that account for the interplay between neural plasticity and behavioral adaptation. Furthermore, policymakers have begun incorporating neuroscience evidence into social welfare programs, recognizing that early childhood adversity affects long-term cognitive development and economic productivity. The integration of these perspectives has led to cross-disciplinary collaborations examining how individual neurobiology, psychological resilience factors, and systemic social support structures collectively influence mental health outcomes across populations."

We observed that elevated temperatures increased metabolic rates of heterotrophic organisms, subsequently accelerating carbon mineralization and reducing soil carbon sequestration capacity. Additionally, altered precipitation patterns disrupted mycorrhizal networks, which are critical for nutrient cycling and plant water uptake. These findings suggest that climate-driven changes in microbial function could trigger positive feedback loops, further amplifying greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial ecosystems."

While 'positive feedback loops' addresses feedback mechanisms, the solution misses 'ecosystem resilience' and 'human impact on soil health' as synthesized inferred themes.
